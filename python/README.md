### Project Checklist

#### 1. Hello World + Variables Playground
- [x] Print “Hello, World”
- [x] Declare and print variables (string, int, float, bool)
- [x] Add comments and experiment with Python syntax

#### 2. FizzBuzz
- [ ] Print numbers 1–100
- [ ] Use `if`, `elif`, `else` to print “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz”

#### 3. Temperature Converter
- [ ] Take user input via `input()`
- [ ] Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- [ ] Use functions to organize logic

#### 4. Four Function Calculator
- [ ] Take two numbers and an operator from user
- [ ] Perform +, -, *, /
- [ ] Add error handling with `try`/`except`

#### 5. Gradebook System
- [ ] Use `dict` to store student names and grades
- [ ] Calculate and print average grades
- [ ] Iterate with `for` loops

#### 6. Todo List App (Console-based)
- [ ] Add a task to a list
- [ ] Mark as done / delete a task
- [ ] Use `while` loop to manage program flow

#### 7. Password Strength Checker
- [ ] Input a password
- [ ] Check for length, numbers, uppercase/lowercase, symbols
- [ ] Use string methods or `re` (regex) module

#### 8. Guess the Number Game
- [ ] Use `random.randint()` to generate number
- [ ] Get user input and give feedback
- [ ] Track number of attempts

#### 9. File Reader Summary
- [ ] Open and read a `.txt` file
- [ ] Print number of lines, words, and characters
- [ ] Handle file exceptions with `try`/`except`

#### 10. Timer/Stopwatch
- [ ] Use `time` module to track seconds
- [ ] Implement countdown or stopwatch mode

### 12. Data Structure Implementations

- [ ] Dynamic Array (use built-in `list`, implement resizing manually)
- [ ] Singly Linked List (class-based)
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Stack (list or linked list)
- [ ] Queue (list or `collections.deque`)
- [ ] Deque (implement with `deque`)
- [ ] Hash Map (`dict` + custom implementation for collisions)
- [ ] Hash Set (`set` + custom hash table implementation)
- [ ] Binary Tree (Node class + recursive traversals)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (insert, delete, search)
- [ ] MinHeap / MaxHeap (array-based with `heapq` or custom)
- [ ] Trie (Node + dictionary-based children)
- [ ] Graph (adjacency list using `dict` of lists)
- [ ] Graph Traversals
  - [ ] DFS (recursive + stack)
  - [ ] BFS (queue with `collections.deque`)
