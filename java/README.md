### Project Checklist

#### 1. Hello World + Variables Playground
- [ ] Print ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù using `System.out.println()`
- [ ] Declare variables with appropriate types (String, int, double, boolean)
- [ ] Use single-line and multi-line comments

#### 2. FizzBuzz
- [ ] Use a `for` loop and `if-else` to print Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz

#### 3. Temperature Converter
- [ ] Use `Scanner` to take user input
- [ ] Perform conversion using methods
- [ ] Use `System.out.printf()` for clean output

#### 4. Four Function Calculator
- [ ] Use `switch` statement to handle operations
- [ ] Add input validation and handle divide-by-zero with `try-catch`

#### 5. Gradebook System
- [ ] Use `ArrayList` and `HashMap` to store names and grades
- [ ] Compute and print averages
- [ ] Use iteration (`for`, `foreach`)

#### 6. Todo List App (Console-based)
- [ ] Use Java collections (`ArrayList`)
- [ ] Allow adding, deleting, and displaying tasks

#### 7. Password Strength Checker
- [ ] Use `String` methods and regex with `Pattern` and `Matcher`
- [ ] Validate length, character types, symbols

#### 8. Guess the Number Game
- [ ] Use `Random` class
- [ ] Take guesses with `Scanner`
- [ ] Give feedback until guessed correctly

#### 9. File Reader Summary
- [ ] Use `File` and `Scanner` for file input
- [ ] Count lines, words, characters
- [ ] Handle exceptions with `try-catch`

#### 10. Timer/Stopwatch
- [ ] Use `System.currentTimeMillis()` for timing
- [ ] Create a simple stopwatch or timer class

### 11. Mini LeetCode Starter Problems
- [ ] Reverse a string using loops or `StringBuilder`
- [ ] Find max in an array
- [ ] Check if a number is prime

### 12. Data Structure Implementations

- [ ] Dynamic Array (custom class with resizing)
- [ ] Singly Linked List (Node class + operations)
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Stack (`push`, `pop`, `peek`)
- [ ] Queue (`enqueue`, `dequeue`)
- [ ] Deque
- [ ] Hash Map (with collision handling)
- [ ] Hash Set (with hashing logic)
- [ ] Binary Tree (preorder, inorder, postorder)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (insert, delete, search)
- [ ] Heap (MinHeap/MaxHeap with array)
- [ ] Trie (Node class + insert/search)
- [ ] Graph (adjacency list with `HashMap`)
- [ ] DFS and BFS (recursive/iterative)
