**A repository of simple mini projects to solidify fundamentals in different programming languages... for the purpose of making sure I am comfortable leetcoding in my languages.**

---

### **1. Hello World + Variables Playground**
- **Concepts**: printing, variables, data types, comments
- **Project**: Print “Hello, World”, then create and print different types of variables (string, int, float, bool).
- **Why**: Learn syntax basics, variable declarations, and output.

---

### **2. FizzBuzz**
- **Concepts**: loops, conditionals, modulo, printing
- **Project**: Print numbers 1–100 with "Fizz" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" by 5, and "FizzBuzz" by both.
- **Why**: Practice logic, control flow, and common LeetCode-style patterns.

---

### **3. Temperature Converter**
- **Concepts**: input/output, arithmetic, functions
- **Project**: Convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit with user input.
- **Why**: Gets you working with user interaction and reusable code.

---

### **4. Four Function Calculator**
- **Concepts**: user input, functions, switch/case or `if-else`, error handling
- **Project**: A calculator that supports +, -, *, /
- **Why**: Introduces input validation and combining functions with control flow.

---

### **5. Gradebook System (List + Dict practice)**
- **Concepts**: lists/arrays, dictionaries/maps, iteration
- **Project**: Store students’ names and grades, calculate averages, print results.
- **Why**: You’ll practice data structures and traversing them.

---

### **6. Todo List App (Console-based)**
- **Concepts**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), loops, input, lists
- **Project**: Create a todo list where you can add, delete, mark done.
- **Why**: Teaches state management and simulates how apps store and modify data.

---

### **7. Password Strength Checker**
- **Concepts**: strings, functions, logic, length checking, `any()`/regex
- **Project**: User enters a password; you return if it's weak, medium, strong.
- **Why**: Prepares you for string manipulation problems in LeetCode.

---

### **8. Guess the Number Game**
- **Concepts**: random number generation, loops, input, comparison
- **Project**: User tries to guess a number until correct, get hints like “too high/low”.
- **Why**: Engaging and practices loops + conditionals + randomness.

---

### **9. File Reader Summary**
- **Concepts**: file I/O, strings, exception handling
- **Project**: Read a text file and print the number of lines, words, characters.
- **Why**: Intro to file manipulation — useful for input-heavy coding problems.

---

### **10. Timer/Stopwatch**
- **Concepts**: system libraries, time/delay functions, loops
- **Project**: Create a timer that runs for X seconds or a stopwatch that tracks time.
- **Why**: Teaches interaction with built-in libraries, great for async understanding later.

### 11. Mini LeetCode Starter Project
- **Project**: Implement 3 classic problems:  
  1. Reverse a string  
  2. Find max in array  
  3. Check if a number is prime
### **12. Data structure practice:**
Implement the following:
  1. Dyanmic array - resizing
  2. Singly linked list - insertion at head/ tail, delete, reverse
  2a. Doubly linked list
  4. Stack - push(), pop(), peek(), isEmpty()
  5. Queue - enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), isEmpty()
  6. Deque - double-ended queue
  7. hash map/ hash table
     - handle collisions (chaining/ open addressing)
     - operations: insert, search, delete
     - load factor and resizing
  8. Hash set - using a hashmap (key only)
  9. Binary tree - preorder, inorder, postorder traversals (recursively and iteratively)
  10. BST - insert, search, delete, inorder traversal returns sorted vals
  11. Heap (min and max) - using array; insert, remove (heapify up/down)
  12. Trie (prefi tree) insert, search, startsWith
  13. Graph (adjacency list)
  14a. Graph traversals
      - DFS (recursive + iterative)
      - BFS (queue)

### Learning objectives:
Each project builds familiarity in the following
- **Variables + Conditionals**
- **Loops**
- **Functions** 
- **Data Structures** 
- **File I/O & Libraries**
